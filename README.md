# AIgoSup Project 5 Group C

This is the 5th Project of the Year 2021-2022 at Algosup. This project aims to build a Neural Network able to recognize wether someone nearby is speaking French or 
English, the model is then uploaded to an Arduino Nano 33 BLE where it can listen through the integrated microphone, infeer the heard sound using the model and then
output the result through a RGB LED. 

## Links to the Google Colabs

The Jupiter notebooks used in the project are all on the Github Repository but they are also uploaded to Colabs for ease of use.

1st Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a4Fk2ZnI94EUOsxv4tHjlwx9wGU9_MPm?usp=sharing

This Colab was our first attempts at making the model and is now depreciated

2nd Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VMPheGEwORD_Qd8KmwOGJOu447fIfRDd?usp=sharing

This Colab was our next attempt at making the model, using TFLite and the Arduino Speech Recognition exemple

## Trying out our Model

Use this Colab to try out our model, don't forget to change the values in the First Cell, and then use "Run All"
